This is a micro-plugin for the [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) editor. It sets
several terminal control sequences used for communication between Vim and the
[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) terminal multiplexer.

Note: whether this plugin will be useful to you or not depends on your terminal
emulator, termcap configuration etc. It is possible that your Linux / Vim
distribution ships with these control sequences already configured.
